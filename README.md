# Horisean HW project 

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- Applying HTML semantics and alt tags for webpage
- To ensure that the webpage is SEO ADA compliant and ensuring that it is easy to read for other developers/webdesigners.
- ensuring that it is ADA compliant means that it also makes it where if for any reason the images do not appear, people with certain disabilites are still able to read or understand it.
- I learned the importance of making sure a webpage is designed for people of all types, as well as making it easier to find code that is well orgnanized when inspected/view source
